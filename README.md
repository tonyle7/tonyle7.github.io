I went for the Jquery approach as thatâ€™s the library I'm most combatable with. I think this would have been great to have been developed with react or angular but as mentioned to Katya during the telephone this is something I'm lacking hence the reason why I am interested in a position at Whitbread.

I decided to use the google maps api to get the longitude and latitude from a location. I then parsed this into the query string to return the json object. I then looped through the "groups" and "items" object to access the "venue" object which allowed me to access the property for "name". As an extra I also accessed the "url" property if it existed and used that as a hyperlink.

I styled this using scss as it the main pre-processor I use.
